# OpenFeignCommunicationDemo
OpenFeignCommunicationDemo is a simple, well‑structured Spring Boot project that demonstrates how to enable inter‑service communication using Spring Cloud OpenFeign. The repository showcases how microservices can communicate with each other in a clean, declarative, and type‑safe manner—without manually writing REST template boilerplate code.
